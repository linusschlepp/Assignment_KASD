# My final Assigment in Advanced Fullstack Development


## About

I called my Assigment "Placemark". Placemark enables to user to store placemarks and categorize them. The user is able to add Images, names,
longitude and latitude to the individual placemarks. Each placemarks is visible on a map, powered by [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) and the pictures of the placemarks can be viewed in a Gallery. 
Those images are getting hosted on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/). The different datasets (Users, Categories, Placemarks) are stored in a [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/lp/try2-de?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=gs_emea_germany_search_core_brand_atlas_desktop&utm_term=mongodb&utm_medium=cpc_paid_search&utm_ad=e&utm_ad_campaign_id=12212624524&adgroup=115749704783&gclid=CjwKCAjw77WVBhBuEiwAJ-YoJLefdXwJTXGPbzm2Jx-LqjGXi4lQbZ_K4sKP8Xt6PYSBFs7RzEDIThoCRB8QAvD_BwE)
Database and are structured according to this UML-Class-Diagram:

The backend uses [Hapi](https://hapi.dev/) while the frontend is written in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). Front- and backend communicate via a api, which is powered by [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
